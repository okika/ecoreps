                    <p class="quarter-top-space">Kelly is a sophomore in Columbia College majoring in economics with a probable concentration in sustainable development. Before she became president she was a Living Green committee head and loved the fact that the committee worked so closely with students in residence halls. Outside of EcoReps, Kelly enjoys doing community service with a club called Circle K and planning events for residents in John Jay, where she is an RA. She also liked enjoying as much time in the sun as possible when it is warm, because she's originally from Texas where it is warm practically all year round!</p>

                    <p class="quarter-top-space">James is a sophomore studying Earth and Environmental Engineering and is interested in the management and development of our natural resources. His interest in the environment started from a young age. He would often go on all sorts of outdoors adventures with his family, and in high school he was able to attend a school focused on environmental science. He has been able to draw on these experiences during his time as treasurer and as a member of our composting committee. In his free time, James loves to explore the great outdoors in the state of New York. During the school year he enjoys venturing into Central Park, but whenever he can he makes the journey to the Adirondack Park in upstate NY. In addition to EcoReps, James is also a part of COOP, A2E2S, Greenborough, and CU Ski Team. A fun fact about James is that he leaves his windows open year round, and some even say he enjoyed the brutally cold winter this year.</p>
